# passwords
A combination of Python scripts to generate, filter, and perform operations on password lists.

## combined.py
Run this with no arguments to combine all text files in the lists directory except the files in the OutputFiles array.
IE to add more passwords, put the file in the lists/ directory, rename lists/unique_combined.lst to something else. Then run this script to recreate it with the new files as well.
You are expected to modify the main function to get the passwords you want using the functions above.
